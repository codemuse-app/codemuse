# Story

Inspired by the challenges of onboarding developers onto large projects and the disconnect between project managers and technical teams we faced off during our previous experiences, **CodeMuse** was born. 

We recognized that even small tasks like bug fixes and minor features demanded extensive codebase navigation. Our solution? Harnessing advanced AI to transform code exploration into a natural language process, dramatically reducing the learning curve. **CodeMuse** also provides intuitive business documentation, easing the understanding of code from a business perspective.

Join us at **CodeMuse**, where we're making coding more accessible and bridging the gap between technical complexity and business strategy.
